# üñ•Ô∏è Amazon Laptops Data Cleaning & Analysis

This project focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing** of laptop listings scraped from Amazon.  
The raw dataset contained messy, inconsistent text values (e.g., "No RAM", "Windows 11 Home", "1 TB", "15.6 Inches").  
Using Python and Pandas, the data was transformed into clean, numeric, and standardized formats ‚Äî ready for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** or **machine learning models**.
